Pedestrian Detection and Tracking Based on Deep Learning                                                          Jan. 2017 - May 2017	
•   Implemented algorithms to identify and track specific pedestrian in different videos using Caffe with Python.
•   Added the video processing and tracking part based on Faster R-CNN, make it an end to end system.
•   Improved anchor’s number and size, region of interest and image size to raise speed and precision.
•   Implemented a 40% performance speed-up without sacrificing accuracy by optimizing the algorithm.
